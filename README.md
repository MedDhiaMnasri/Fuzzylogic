### Fuzzy Logic  

Fuzzy Logic is a computational approach inspired by human reasoning, enabling systems to handle uncertainty and approximate reasoning. Unlike traditional binary logic, which operates with true or false values, Fuzzy Logic works with degrees of truth, making it ideal for complex systems where precise inputs are unavailable. It is widely applied in control systems, robotics, and decision-making algorithms to model non-linear, uncertain, or ambiguous environments.
